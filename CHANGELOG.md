## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Do not wrap `Setter.Expressions()` in parenthesis

## [v0.23.0] - 2024-01-03

### Added

- Add `bob.Cache()` which saves the built SQL and args to prevent rebuilding the same query multiple times.
- Add `As()` starter to alias expressions
- Add `OP()` builder method for using custom operators
- Add `table.InsertQ(ctx, db)` now includes the insert columns from the table model.
- It is now possible to configure additional constraints for code generation.
- Add `um.SetCol()` which maintains the old behavior of `um.Set()`.
- Generate additional `Expressions()` method for Setters to make it easier to use them in `um.Set()` or `im.Set()`.

### Changed

- Aliases configuration for code generation no longer has a top level `table` key
- When configuring relationships, `from_unique`, `to_unique`, `key_nullable` can no longer be configured. They are now inferred from the database.
- When configuring relationships, `to_key` has been changed to `modify` and should be set to `from`, `to` or `""` to indicate which side of the relationship to modify.
  If left empty, Bob will try to guess which side to modify based on the presence of primary keys and unique columns.
- `RelWhere.Value` is now `RelWhere.SQLValue`
- Change CONFLICT/DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE to use mods instead of a chainable methods.
- Change `um.Set()` to take a list of expressions.
- Rename Setter method from `Insert()` to `InsertMod()` to avoid confusion.

### Fixed

- Prevent generating duplicate relationships for many-to-many self-join relationships
- Correctly use table alias in generated relationship join mods
- Fix an issue where CTEs were encased in double parenthesis
- Fix invalid SQL generated when doing `JOIN USING`
- Correctly include "AS" in function query if alias is set
- Setters are also generated for tables that have relationships, even if they have no primary key
- Column aliases in CTEs are now correctly included in the final query
- Fix several issues with generating code for multi-sided relationships
- Fix an issue where loading many-to-many relationships cause no columns to be selected unless specified
- Fix an issue where many-to-many relationships would not be able to use nested loaders

## [v0.22.0] - 2023-08-18

### Added

- Expand expressions when used in Raw (thanks @RangelReale)
- Add `InsertQ`, `UpdateQ`, and `DeleteQ` methods to Table models to start INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE queries respectively.
- Allow column comment for replacement matching (thanks @jroenf)
- Add table query hooks to modify model queries
- Include `WhereOr` and `WhereAnd` to make it easier to combine multiple generated where clauses
- Print a warning if a replacement rule did not find a match (thanks @jacobmolby)

### Changed

- Export generated factory.Factory struct
- Allow Limit and Offset to be used as Arguments in PostgreSQL (thanks @RangelReale)
- Make model hooks take slices not single objects
- Return rows affected from `Exec()` method of view queries instead of `sql.Result`
- Chain comparison methods now take an `Expression` instead of `any`
- Table models now require the types to implement `orm.Table` and `orm.Setter` interfaces.

### Removed

- Remove UpdateAll and DeleteAll methods on the Table models.

### Fixed

- Honor Only and Except in sqlite driver
- Always surround subqueries with parenthesis when used as an expression
- Fix mysql `TablesInfo` method and make sure we don't exclude entire table when targeting columns (thanks @jacobmolby)

## [v0.20.0] - 2023-04-03

### Added

- Add the `PreloadWhere` preload mod to filter what relation should be preloaded.

- Improve `Debug` helpers.
  - `Debug` writes query output to stdout
  - `DebugToWriter` writes the query output to any `io.Writer` with a fallback to stdout.
  - `DebugToPrinter` prints the query with a given `bob.DebugPrinter`. Also falls back to stdout.
- Rename `OnlyColumns` to `PreloadOnly` and `ExceptColumns` to `PreloadExcept` to be more consistent with the newly added `PreloadWhere`.
