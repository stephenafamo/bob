# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `drivers/pgx.Pool` now includes the methods `Acquire` and `AcquireFunc` which mirror the methods in `pgx/v5/pgxpool` to acquire a connection from the pool (thanks @Eyal-Shalev).
- Added the `drivers/pgx.PoolConn` type which is a wrapper around `pgx/v5/pgxpool.Conn`.

### Changed

- Use the full column type and not just the datatype as the `DBType` in bobgen-mysql.
- `bob.Transactor` is now a generic interface so that implementations can use a concrete transaction type.
- The data types generated for SQLite now follow SQLite's type affinity rules more closely (excluding some common names). As a result, all integer types are now mapped to `int64` and all floating point types are mapped to `float64`.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `bobgen-mysql` could not detect unsigned integer columns in queries.
- Properly close `pgx` transactions if the context used in `BeginTx` is cancelled.
- Fix issues with generating code for relationships defined with `WhereExpr`.
- Support `uint64` type when scanning columns as `types.Uint64`. This fixes scanning `BIGINT UNSIGNED` MySQL columns as `types.Uint64` when `interpolateParams` is enabled. (thanks @luiscleto)

## [v0.40.2] - 2025-08-16

### Fixed

- Fixed Scanner/Valuer test gen for types defined in the models package.
- Fix issue with randomization test when enum is only used in an array.
- Fix issue with using `CompareExpr` with values that are null.
- Fix issue with imports in query tests.
- Fix issue with detecting the columns in a CTE in `bobgen-psql`.
- Properly detect the end of a function call in postgres qury parser.

## [v0.40.1] - 2025-08-14

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in preloading

## [v0.40.0] - 2025-08-13

### Added

- Made code generation modular by relying on built-in plugins that can be enabled or disabled in the configuration.
  - `dbinfo`: Generates code for information about each database. Schemas, tables, columns, indexes, primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.
  - `enums`: Generates code for enums in a separate package, if there are any present.
  - `models`: Generates code for models. Depends on `enums`.
  - `factory`: Generates code for factories. Depends on `models`.
  - `dberrors`: Generates code for unique constraint errors. Depends on `models`.
  - `where`: Generates type-safe code for `WHERE` clauses in queries. Depends on `models`.
  - `loaders`: Adds templates to the `models` package to generate code for loaders e.g `models.SelectThenLoad.Table.Rel()`.
  - `joins`: Adds templates to the `models` package to generate code for joins e.g `models.SelectJoin.Table.LeftJoin.Rel`.
  - `queries`: Generates code for queries.
- Added new `types.Uint64` type that sends values to the database as strings. This is necessary because using `uint64` directly can cause an overflow if the value exceeds the maximum value of an `int64`. This is a limitation imposed by `database/sql/driver.Valuer` interface.
- Added support for `pgvector` types during code generation.
  - `pgvector.Vector`
  - `pgvector.HalfVector`
  - `pgvector.SparseVector`

### Changed

- Enums are now imported directly from a new generated `enums` package. This makes it easier to use enums in other packages without having to depend on the `models` package.
- Preload functions now take a custom `orm.PreloadRel` struct instead of reusing `orm.Relationship`.
- By default, factories are now generated in `./factory` instead of `./models/factory`.
- Outputs are now determined by plugins which can be enabled or disabled in the configuration.
- UniqueConstraintErrors are now generated in a separate `dberrors` package instead of being generated in the `models` package.
- Tests in the generated `models` package are no longer generated in a separate `models_test` package. There is no longer any circular dependency since tests for the unique constraint errors are generated in the `dberrors` package.
- `orm.Columns` has been moved to `expr.ColumnsExpr`.
- `orm.NewColumns` has been moved to `expr.NewColumnsExpr`.
- `<Table>.Columns()` is removed. The columns expression is now expected to be embedded in the `Columns` field of the `<Table>` struct.
- `<dialect>.View` and `<dialect>.Table` now take an additional type parameter for the columns type. This is assigned to the `Columns` field with `NewView/NewTable` functions.

### Removed

- Removed the `no_factory` configuration option. It is now replaced with the `factory` plugin which can be enabled or disabled. See <https://bob.stephenafamo.com/docs/code-generation/configuration#plugins-configuration> for more details.
- Removed the `Only` and `Except` exported functions in `orm`. They are now in the private `internal` package.
- Removed the generated `models.<Model>Columns` global variable. It can now be accessed through `models.<Table>.Columns`.
- Removed the generated `models.TableNames` and `models.ColumnNames` global variables. Their use can be replaced with the `dbinfo` plugin which generates a `dbinfo` package with all the information about the database.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with redundant title casing column names in query templates. (thanks @luiscleto)
- Fix invalid expression with pointer-based type systems. (thanks @tak848)
- Fix panic when parsing SQLite `UPDATE` queries that do not contain a `FROM` clause.
- Fix issue when using enums in generated queries.
- Fix randomization of floats and decimals in the factory.
- Fix JSON data being incorrectly hex-encoded as bytea when using pgx through simple protocol, causing PostgreSQL to reject it with invalid input syntax errors. (by @Maxitosh)
- Fix issue with preload queries not using a defined schema on the related tables

## [v0.39.0] - 2025-07-28

### Added

- Added the `As` method to `clause.TableRef`, which sets the alias and return a copy of the struct. (thanks @Nitjsefni7)
- Added the `type_system` configuration option to determine how to generate null and optional values in the generated code.
  Possible options: `github.com/aarondl/opt`, `github.com/aarondl/opt/null` or `database/sql`. The default value is `github.com/aarondl/opt`.
- When generating code for queries, The `All` method of the generated query will return a struct with nested fields instead of a flat struct.
  - columns with dots (`.`) are assumed to be a `to-many` nested field.
  - columns with double underscores (`__`) are assumed to be a `to-one` nested field.
- Implement `--prefix` annotation in queries for `bobgen-psql`.
- Add FromExisting**Rel** method to factories to create a template from an existing model. (thanks @dutow)
- Add WithExisting**Rel** to factory mods to attach an existing model as a relationship. (thanks @dutow)
- Added support in psql for combined args (order by, limit etc.) in combined queries and use parens if they are present. (@iwyrkore)
- Added parens for combined queries. (@iwyrkore)
- Match columns using regular expressions in type replacements. This is useful for e.g. matching columns that have a common prefix or suffix. (thanks @abdusco)

### Changed

- `Mod` is now a separate field in `orm.ModQuery` and `orm.ModExecQuery`.
- `Allx` now takes a `Transformer` type parameter to transform the result of the query.
- Updated documentation for readability, added code gen examples. (thanks @singhsays)
- Columns are now matched in a case-insensitive manner in type replacements. (thanks @abdusco)
- Columns can now be matched with as many conditions as needed in type replacements. This removes the previous requirement that boolean fields had to be specified in addition to a string field. (thanks @abdusco)
- Factories now expose a `NewXWithContext` that accepts a context in addition to `NewX` that does not. This provides a cleaner API for the callers, while still allowing the use of context internally. (thanks @abdusco)

### Removed

- Removed the `fallback_null` configuration option. It is now replaced with the `type_system` configuration option.

### Fixed

- Fixed some issues with creating relationships in the factory by avoiding trying to reuse models.
- Fix issues with generating code for queries with duplicate return column names.
- Updated gen table detail queries to use context. (thanks @singhsays)
- Properly detect `bool`, `timestamp` and `timestamptz` types in `bobgen-psql`.
- Fix transformer for single result queries.
- Properly handle indexes where the sorting order can be null.
- Check for nullability when loading relationships.
- Handle table names quoted with backticks in mysql query parser. (thanks @luiscleto)
- Allow matching columns in type replacements by the `autoincr` property as stated in the docs. (thanks @abdusco)
- Handle dashes and spaces in generated enum values properly (thanks @abdusco)
- Check for nullability when loading relationships from Slices (thanks @felipeparaujo)

## [v0.38.0] - 2025-06-04

### Added

- Added the `fallback_null` top level configuraiton option. Which can be either `database/sql` or `github.com/aarondl/opt/null`.  
   This is used to determine how to create null values in the generated code. If set to `database/sql`, it will use `sql.Null[T]` for nullable types, and if set to `github.com/aarondl/opt/null`, it will use `opt.null.Val[T]`.  
   The default value is `database/sql`.

### Fixed

- Correctly build models with nested relationships in the factory.
- Fix a performance issue with code generation in `bobgen-psql`.
- Use the correct alias when generating table columns.
- Fix issue with generating factory code for tables with schema names.

## [v0.37.0] - 2025-05-31

### Added

- Added the `drivers/pgx` package which contains types and functions to use a `pgx/v5` connection as a `bob.Executor`.
- Added support for `github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3`. (thanks @ncruces)
- Added support for configuring what type to generate specific null versions of a type instead of always wrapping with `sql.Null[T]`.

### Changed

- The `bob.Transaction` interface now takes a `context.Context` argument in the `Commit` and `Rollback` methods.
- The method `BeginTx` on the `bob.Transaction` interface is now changed to `Begin` and it takes a single context argument.  
   This is to make it easier to implement for non `database/sql` drivers.
- In the generated model, the `PrimaryKeyVals()` method is now private.
- Renamed `driver_name` to `driver` in code generation configuration.
- In type replacements, nullability is not used in matching.
  Previously, nullability of matches was set to false by default, and would require an additional replacement to also match nullable columns.

### Removed

- Removed the `New` and `NewQueryer` functions. Any of `bob.NewDB`, `bob.NewTx` or `bob.NewConn` can be used instead.
- Removed the `StdInterface` interface as it is unnecessary.
- Remove redundant `orm.Model` interface.
- Remove dependence on `github.com/aarondl/opt` in generated code.
  - Nullable values are now wrapped `database/sql.Null` with instead of `github.com/aarondl/opt/null.Val`.
  - Optional values are now represented as pointers instead of `github.com/aarondl/opt/omit.Val[T]`.
- Removed `in_generated_package` type configuration option. This was limited and could only indicate that the type is in the models package.
  Instead the full import path can now be used in the `imports` configuration option, and if it is in the same package as the generated code, the prefix will be automatically removed.

### Fixed

- Properly handle `nil` args when checking if default or null in `mysql` table insert query.
- Fix bug in querying slice relationships in MySQL and SQLite.

## [v0.36.1] - 2025-05-27

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with generating correct test code for nullable args in SQL queries.
- Fix issue where writing the "NO EDIT Disclaimer" at the top of Go generated files was skipped.

## [v0.36.0] - 2025-05-27

### Changed

- Loaders are now generated as singular instead of plural. This feels more natural when using them in code.

  ```go
  // Before
  models.Preload.Users.Pilots()
  models.SelectThenLoad.Users.Pilots()

  // After
  models.Preload.User.Pilots()
  models.SelectThenLoad.User.Pilot()
  ```

## [v0.35.1] - 2025-05-27

### Fixed

- Store `types.Time` as an RFC3339 string in the DB

## [v0.35.0] - 2025-05-26

### Added

- Added support to generate code for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries in `bobgen-mysql`.
- Added support to generate code for `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries in `bobgen-sqlite`.
- Added `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to the SQLite Update and Delete queries.
- Added `IndexedBy` and `NotIndexed` mods to the SQLite Delete queries.
- Added the `Transactor` and `Transaction` interfaces.
- Added the `SeparatePackageForTests` attribute to generation outputs to indicate if generated tests should have their own package.
- Added the `RandomColumnNotNull` mod to factories to generate random values for non-nullable columns without the chance of being null.
- Added the `WithOneRelations` mod to factories to include every relation for a factory template.
- Added `clause.TableRef` which merges `clause.Table` and `clause.From` since they had overlapping functionality.
- Added `RunInTx` method to `bob.DB`. This starts a transaction and calls the given function with this transaction.
- Add support for MySQL to `bobgen-sql`.
- Added `Exec` test for generated queries that do not return rows.
- Added `OrderCombined`, `LimitCombined`, `OffsetCombined` mods to MySQL `SELECT` queries. These are applied to the result of a `UNION`, `INTERSECT` or `EXCEPT` query.
- Added `type_limits` property to column definitions.
- Added `limits` option to `random_expr` function for types. This is to pass any column limits to the randomization function (e.g. `max_length` for strings).
- Added tests to check that the generated factory can create models and save into the database.
- Added the `pgtypes.Snapshot` type for the `pg_snapshot` and `txid_snapshot` type in PostgreSQL.
- Added a custom `Time` type to the `types` package. This is motivated by the fact that the `libsql` driver does not support the `time.Time` type properly.
- Added an option to disable aliasing when expressing `expr.Columns`. Also added `EnableAlias` and `DisableAlias` methods to `expr.Columns` to control this behavior.
- Added a `PrimaryKey` method to `{dialect}.Table` to get the primary key columns of the table.

### Changed

- Changed the INDEXED BY and NOT INDEXED mods for SQLite update queries from `TableIndexedBy` and `TableNotIndexed` to `IndexedBy` and `NotIndexed`.
- Use `LIBSQL_TEST_SERVER` environment variable to run tests against a libSQL server instead of the hardcoded `localhost:8080`.
- `BeginTx` now returns a `Transaction` interface instead of a `bob.Tx`.
- Generated tests that required a database connection no longer create a new connection for each test. Instead it depends on a `testDB` connection that the user has to provide.
- In the generated models, relationships for `ModelSlice` are now loaded using arrays to reduce the number of parameter in the query.

  ```sql
  -- Before
  SELECT * FROM pilots WHERE jet_id IN ($1, $2, $3, ...); -- Parameters increase with the number of pilots

  -- After
  SELECT * FROM pilots WHERE jet_id IN (SELECT unnest(CAST($1 AS integer[])); -- Parameters are always 1
  ```

- In the generated model code, `Preload` is now a struct instead of multiple standaalone functions.  
   It is now used like `Preload.User.Pilots()`, instead of `PreloadUserPilots()`.
- In the generated model code, `ThenLoad` is now a struct and has been split for each query type.  
   It is now used like `SelectThenLoad.User.Pilots()`, instead of `ThenLoadUserPilots()`.
- In the generated model code, the **Load** interfaces no longer include the name of the source model since it is a method on the model.  
   It now looks like `*models.User.LoadPilots` instead of `*models.User.LoadUserPilots`.
- Made changes to better support generating code in multiple languages.
- Mark queries with `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` as unretrievable in MySQL.
- Unretrievable `INSERT` queries using `One, All, Cursor` now immediately return `orm.ErrCannotRetrieveRow` instead of executing the query first.
- Generated tests are now run when testing drivers.
- `MEDIUMINT` and `MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED` are now generated as `int16` and `uint16` respectively. This is because Go doe not support 24 bit integers.
- The randomization function for floats, strings, and decimals now respect the limits set in the column definition.
- `txid_snapshot` is now generated as `pgtypes.Snapshot` instead of `pgtypes.TxIDSnapshot`.
- `cidr` postgres type is now generated as `types.Text[netip.Prefix]` instead of `types.Text[netip.Addr]`.
- `money` postgres type is now generated as a string with a custom randomization expression instead of a decimal.
- Factory template mods now take a context argument. This allows for more control when using recursive mods.
- Removed `WithOneRelations` mod from factories, now replaced with `WithParentsCascading` which also includes parents for any parent relationships.

### Removed

- Removed `clause.Table` and `clause.From`, and merge into `clause.TableRef` since they had overlapping functionality.
- Remove unnecessary context closure in generated join helpers.
- Remove the deprecated `wipe` generation option.
- Remove `pgtypes.TxIDSnapshot` type. This is now replaced with `pgtypes.Snapshot`.

### Fixed

- Use correct row name for generated queries in `bobgen-sqlite`.
- Properly select query comment in `bobgen-sqlite`.
- Fixed issue with using generated queries with `VALUES` as mods.
- Moved `Partitions` in MySQL delete queries to after the table alias.
- Fixed issue with inserting into a table with all rows having default values in SQLite.
- Use table name and not table alias in SQLite returning clause since the alias is not available in the `RETURNING` clause.
- Fixed generated unique constraint errors for SQLite.
- Correctly resuse inserted rows in factories.

## [v0.34.2] - 2025-05-01

### Fixed

- Fix issue with verifying statements in `bobgen-psql`.

## [v0.34.0] - 2025-04-30

### Added

- Added support to generate code for `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries in `bobgen-psql`.

### Changed

- Changed to non-cgo version of postgres parser.
- Changed the `dir` configuration for `bobgen-sql` to `pattern` and it now takes a glob pattern. This allows excluding certain files from being included (e.g. `.down.sql` files).

## [v0.33.1] - 2025-04-26

### Changed

- When a query returns only one column, instead of returning a struct with one field, it will return the type of the column. This is to make it easier to use the generated code.

### Fixed

- Fix panic when scanning returned rows from generated queries.

## [v0.33.0] - 2025-04-26

### Added

- Added support to generate code for `INSERT` queries in `bobgen-psql`.
- `clause.Confict` now takes `bob.Expression`, and the fields are now moved to a `clause.ConflictClause` struct.

### Changed

- Make grouped types in generated queries a type alias.

### Removed

- Remove `models.InsertWhere` in generated code since it is not correct.

### Fixed

- Fix issue with column query annotations in `bobgen-psql`.
- Fix issue with parsing multiple queries in the same file in `bobgen-psql`.
- Fix issue with correctly detecting the comment for the query annotation in `bobgen-psql`.
- Use a transaction in generated query tests.
- Account for LEFT, RIGHT and FULL joins when determining the nullability of a column.
- Generate WHERE helpers for `ON CONFLICT` clauses.

## [v0.32.0] - 2025-04-24

- Added `clause.OrderBy.ClearOrderBy()`
- Added `expr.ToArgs` and `expr.ToArgGroup` functions to convert slices of a type to args.

- Add `camelCase` template function.
- Add types to the `orm` package to be used in generated queries. `orm.ArgWithPosition`, `orm.ModExpression`, `orm.ModExecQuery` and `orm.ModQuery`.
- Add function `orm.ArgsToExpression` for use in the generated code.
- Add `String()` method to `bob.QueryType`

### Fixed

- Update `mvdan.cc/gofumpt` and give precedence to toolchain when calculating the Go version. (thanks @isgj)
- Add custom comparison support when loading relationships.
- Fix issue with scanning Postgres inet type.
- Set `Arg` and `ArgGroup` to `NULL` if there are no values.
- Do not call `BeforeInsertHooks` in the insert mod of a view.
- Fix issue with retrieving inserted rows with the MySQL driver.
- Add custom comparison for relationship loading. (thanks @kostaspt)

### Changed

- `clause.With` now takes `bob.Expression` instead of `clause.CTE`. This makes it easier to use in generated queries without reconstruction an `CTE`.
- `clause.OrderBy` now takes `bob.Expression` instead of `clause.OrderDef`. This makes it easier to use in generated queries without reconstruction an `OrderDef`.
- `clause.Windows` now takes `bob.Expression` instead of `clause.NamedWindow`. This makes it easier to use in generated queries without reconstruction the window.
- `clause.For` renemaed to `clause.Locks` and can now take multiple locks.
- `clause.Fetch` now takes `any` instead of an integer.
- Several changes to the `drivers.Query` type as support is added for the new query parser.
- Enum types can now be matched by `db_type` in bobgen-psql as `schema.enum_type`. (thanks @abramlab)

### Removed

- Removed `clause.OrderBy.SetOrderBy()` as it was only being used to clear the set order by clauses.

## [v0.31.0] - 2025-03-26

### Added

- Added support for libSQL. (thanks @mbezhanov)
- Added support for declaring types inside the models package. (thanks @jacobmolby)

### Changed

- Generates error constants with unique indexes instead of unique constraints. (thanks @tlietz)

### Fixed

- Used `Equal` method for comparing decimals. (thanks @jalaziz)
- Update `golang.org/x/mod` dependency to enable parsing of Go 1.23 modules. (thanks @m110)

## [v0.30.0] - 2025-01-16

### Added

- Added a new field `QueryFolders` to `gen/drivers.DBInfo` for drivers to be able to include information about parsed queries.
- Added `gen/QueriesTemplates` which in the future will contain base templates for generating code for parsed qureries.
- Added a `QueryTemplate` field to `bobgen_helpers.Templates` for drivers to include additional templates for queries.
- Added a new reserved output key `queries`. This is handled specially for each query folder supplied by the driver.
- Added new `wm` package to each dialect for mods that modify `Window` clauses.
- Added a new method `Alias` for `View` struct, for each dialect. It returns the alias of the view. (thanks @Nitjsefni7)

### Changed

- Updated error constant generation to employ specific error types for making error matching easier. (thanks @mbezhanov)
- Collation in `clause.OrderDef` is now a string not an expression and is always quoted
- Calling `UpdateAll`, `DeleteAll` and `ReloadAll` on an empty model slice now returns nil without running any queries.
- `UNION`, `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` mods now append to the query instead of replacing it.
- Generated files now end with `.bob.go` instead of `.go` and are always cleaned up before generating new files. Singleton templates are now required to have a `.bob.go.tpl` extension.
- The expected structure for templates have been changed:
  - Previously, singleton templates should be kept in a `singleton` folder. Now, any template not inside a folder is considered a singleton template.
  - Previoulsy, templates in the root folder are merged and run for each table. Now, this will happen to templates in the `table/` folder.
  - Previoulsy, the entire file tree and every subdirectory is walked to find templates. Now only templates in the root folder and the `table/` folder are considered.
- Change `From` in `clause.Window` to `BasedOn` to avoid confusion with `FromPreceding` and `FromFollowing`. Also change `SetFrom` to `SetBasedOn`.
- Embed `clause.OrderBy` in `clause.Window` to make it possible to reuse `OrderBy` mods in window definitions.
- Change the `Definition` field in `clause.NamedWindow` from `any` to `clause.Window` for extra type safety.
- `sm.Window` now takes mods to modify the window clause.
- `fm.Over` now takes mods to modify the window for the window function.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the `wipe` option to delete all files in the output folder. Files are now generated with a `.bob.go` extension and are always cleaned up before generating new files.

### Removed

- Remove redundatnt type parameters from `orm.ExecQuery`.
- Remove unnecessary interface in `orm.Query` and `orm.ExecQuery`.
- Remove the redundant `clause.IWindow` interface.
- Remove `dialect.WindowMod` and `dialect.WindowMods` which use chainable methods to modify `Window` clauses. This is now handled by the `wm` package which used mods.

### Fixed

- Fix random value generation for pq.Float64Array factory (thanks @felipeparaujo)
- Using the `UpdateMod()` and `DeleteMod()` methods on an empty model slice now appends `WHERE primary_key IN NULL` which will return no results. Instead of `WHERE primary_key IN ()` which is a syntax error.
- Ensure `net/netip` is imported for the `pgtypes.Inet` random expression (thanks @plunkettscott)
- Fix a data race when adding enum types.
- Fix missing schema in table alias in pkEQ and pkIN clauses (thanks @adatob).

## [v0.29.0] - 2024-11-20

### Added

- Added error constants for matching against both specific and generic unique constraint errors raised by the underlying database driver. (thanks @mbezhanov)
- Added support for regular expressions in the `only` and `except` table filters. (thanks @mbezhanov)
- Added `ContextualMods` which are similar to regular mods but take a context argument. They are applied whenever the query is built.  
  This makes it cleaner to do certain things, like populating the select columns of a model if none was explicitly added.  
  The previous way this was done was unreliable since using `q.MustBuild()` would not add the columns while `bob.MustBuild(q)` will add them correctly.
- `modelSlice.UpdateMod()` and `modelSlice.DeleteMod()` are new methods that returns a mod for update and delete queries on a slice of models.  
  It adds `WHERE pk IN (pk1, pk2, pk3, ...)` to the query, and also schedule running the **hooks**.
- Added `bob.ToMods` which a slice of structs that implement `bob.Mod[T]` to a Mod. This is useful since Go does not allow using a slice of structs as a slice of an interface the struct implements.
- Added `bob.HookableQuery` interface. If a query implements this interface, the method `RunHooks(ctx, exec)` will be called before the query is executed.
- Added `bob.HookableType` interface. If a type implements this interface, the method `AfterQueryHook(ctx, exec, bob.QueryType)` will be called after the query is executed.  
  This is how `AfterSeleect/Insert/Update/DeleteHooks` hooks are now implemented.
- Added `Type() QueryType` method to `bob.Query` to get the type of query it is. Available constants are `Unknown, Select, Insert, Update, Delete`.
- Postgres and SQLite Update/Delete queries now refresh the models after the query is executed. This is enabled by the `RETURNING` clause, so it is not available in MySQL.
- Added the `Case()` starter to all dialects to build `CASE` expressions. (thanks @k4n4ry)
- Added `bob.Named()` which is used to add named arguments to the query and bind them later.
- Added `bob.BindNamed` which takes an argument (struct, map, or a single value type) to be used to bind named arguments in a query. See changes to `bob.Prepare()` for details of which type can be used.
- Indexes now include more information such as the type, unique and comment fields.
- Constraints now include a comment field.
- Added `Checks` field to DBConstraints so that drivers can also load check constraints. (not yet supported by the SQLite driver).
- Added comments field to Table definitions.

### Changed

- `context.Context` is now passed to `Query.WriteQuery()` and `Expression.WriteSQL()` methods. This allows for more control over how the query is built and executed.  
  This change made is possible to delete some hacks and simplify the codebase.
  - The `Name()` and `NameAs()` methods of Views/Tables no longer need the context argument since the context will be passed when writing the expression. The API then becomes cleaner.
  - Preloading mods no longer need to store a context internally. `SetLoadContext()` and `GetLoadContext()` have removed.
  - The `ToExpr` field in `orm.RelSide` which was used for preloading is no longer needed and has been removed.
- Moved `orm.Hooks` to `bob.Hooks` since it should not be limited to only ORM queries.
- Moved `mods.QueryModFunc` to `bob.ModFunc` since it should be available to all packages.
- The mod capability for `orm.Setter` is now reversed. It should now be a mod for Insert and have a method that returns a mod for Update.  
   This makes more sense since one would at most use one setter during updates, but can use multiple setters in a bulk insert.
- `table.InsertQ` has been renamed to `table.Insert`. The old implementation of `Insert` has been removed.  
   The same functionality can be achieved in the following way:

  ```go
  //----------------------------------------------
  // OLD WAY
  //----------------------------------------------
  user, err := models.Users.Insert(ctx, db, setter) // insert one
  users, err := models.Users.InsertMany(ctx, db, setters...) // insert many

  //----------------------------------------------
  // NEW WAY
  //----------------------------------------------
  user, err := models.Users.Insert(setter).One(ctx, db) // insert one
  users, err := models.Users.Insert(setters[0], setters[1]).All(ctx, db) // insert many

  // For cases where you already have a slice of setters and you want to pass them all, you can use `bob.ToMods`
  users, err := models.Users.Insert(bob.ToMods(setters)).All(ctx, db) // insert many
  ```

- `table.UpdateQ` has been renamed to `table.Update`. The old implementation of `Update` has been removed.  
   The same functionality can be achieved by using `model.Update()` or `modelSlice.UpdateAll()`.
- `table.DeleteQ` has been renamed to `table.Delete`. The old implementation of `Delete` has been removed.  
   The same functionality can be achieved by using `modelSlice.DeleteAll()` or creating an `Delete` query using `table.Delete()`.
- `BeforeInsertHooks` now only takes a single `ModelSetter` at a time.  
   This is because it is not possible to know before executing the queries exactly how many setters are being used since additional rows can be inserted by applying another setter as a mod.
- `bob.Cache()` now requires an `Executor`. This is used to run any query hooks.
- `bob.Prepare()` now requires a type parameter to be used to bind named arguments. The type can either be:
  - A struct with fields that match the named arguments in the query
  - A map with string keys. When supplied, the values in the map will be used to bind the named arguments in the query.
  - When there is only a single named argument, one of the following can be used:
    - A primitive type (int, bool, string, etc)
    - `time.Time`
    - Any type that implements `driver.Valuer`.
- `Index` columns are no longer just strings, but are a struct to include more information such as the sort order.

### Removed

- Remove MS SQL artifacts. (thanks @mbezhanov)
- Remove redundant type parameter from `bob.Load`.
- Removed `Before/AfterUpsertMods`. Upserts are really just inserts with a conflict clause and should be treated as such.
- Removed `Insert/InsertMany/Upsert/UpsertMany` methods from `orm.Table` since they are not needed.  
  It is possible to do the same thing, with similar effor using the the `InsertQ` method (which is now renamed to `Insert`).
- Remove `Update` and `Delete` methods from `orm.Table` since they are not needed.  
  It is possible to do the same thing, with similar effor using the the `UpdateQ` and `DeleteQ` methods (which are now renamed to `Update` and `Delete`).
- `context.Context` and `bob.Executor` are no longer passed when creating a Table/ViewQuery. It is now passed at the point of execution with `Exec/One/All/Cursor`.
- Remove `Prepare` methods from table and view qureries. Since `bob.Prepare()` now takes a type parameter, it is not possible to prepare from a method since Go does not allow additional type parameters in methods.
- Removed the **Prisma** and **Atlas** code generation drivers. It is better for Bob to focus on being able to generate code from the database in the most robust and detailed way and if the user wants, they can use other tools (such as prisma and atlas) to manage migrations before the code generation.
- Removed `Expressions` from Index definitions. It is now merged with the `Columns` field with an `IsExpression` field to indicate if the column is an expression.

### Fixed

- Removed unnecessary import of `strings` in `bobfactory_random.go`.
- Fixed data races in unit tests. (thanks @mbezhanov)
- Fixed invalid SQL statements generated by `sm.OrderBy().Collate()`. (thanks @mbezhanov)
- Fixed a bug preventing specific columns from being excluded when generating models from SQLite. (thanks @mbezhanov)
- Fixed an issue where invalid code is generated if a configured relationship has `from_where` or `to_where`.
- Fixed `ModelSlice.ReloadAll()` method for models with multiple primary keys.

## [v0.28.1] - 2024-06-28

### Fixed

- Also add the enum to the type array if an array of the enum is added. This is to prvent issues if the enum is only used in an array.
- Handle null column names in expression indexes. (thanks @mbezhanov)
- CROSS JOINS now allow aliases

## [v0.28.0] - 2024-06-25

### Added

- Added the `pgtypes.Inet` for `inet` type in PostgreSQL. (thanks @gstarikov)
- Added the `pgtypes.Macaddr` for `macaddr` and `macaddr8` types in PostgreSQL.
- Added the `pgtypes.LSN` type for the `pg_lsn` type in PostgreSQL.
- Added the `pgtypes.TxIDSnapshot` type for the `txid_snapshot` type in PostgreSQL.
- Added the `pgtypes.TSVector` type for the `tsvector` type in PostgreSQL.
- Added `AliasOf` property to codegen type definitions to allow for defining types that have their own randomization logic.
- Added `DependsOn` property to codegen type definitions to allow for defining types that depend on other types. This ensures that necessary code for the dependent types is generated.
- Add `xml` type definition for custom randomization logic.
- Add the `Cast()` starter to all dialects to build `CAST(expr AS type)` expressions.
- Load index information for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite tables. (thanks @mbezhanov)

### Changed

- Changed the `parray` package to `pgtypes`.
- Moved `HStore` to the `pgtypes` package.
- Simplified how random expressions are written for types by using standalone functions instead of a single generic function.
- The default `DebugPrinter` now prints args a bit more nicely by using thier `Value()` method if they implement the `driver.Valuer` interface.
- Only generate 2 random values when testing random expressions.

### Removed

- Removed `types.Stringer[T]`. It makes assumptions for how the type should be scanned and is not reliable.

### Fixed

- Do not add `FROM` clause to `SELECT` queries that are used as subqueries.
- Enum values are now checked for validity after scanning.

## [v0.27.1] - 2024-06-05

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in `Count()` queries not removing the offset from the original query. (thanks @daddz)

## [v0.27.0] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- Add PreloadAs PreloadOption to override the join alias when preloading a relationship with a left join. (thanks @daddz)
- Add `AliasedAs()` method to `tableColumns` and `tableWhere` types to use a custom alias.
- Add `AliasedAs()` method to generated relationship join mods. This is avaible in two places:
  - one to change the alias of the table being queried

    ```go
    models.SelectJoins.Jets.AliasedAs("j").InnerJoin.Pilots(ctx)
    ```

  - and the other to change the alias of the relationship.

    ```go
    models.SelectJoins.Jets.InnerJoin.Pilots(ctx).AliasedAs("p")
    ```

- Add `fm` mods to all supported dialects (psql, mysql and sqlite). These are mods for functions and are used to modify the function call. For example:

  ```go
  // import "github.com/stephenafamo/bob/dialect/psql/fm"
  psql.F( "count", "*",)(fm.Filter(psql.Quote("status").EQ(psql.S("done"))))
  ```

- Add `MustCreate`, `MustCreateMany`, `CreateOrFail` and `CreateManyOrFail` methods to generated factory Templates

### Changed

- Change the function call point for generated relationship join mods. This reduces the amount of allocations and only does the work for the relationship being used.

  ```go
  // Before
  models.SelectJoins(ctx).Jets.InnerJoin.Pilots
  // After
  models.SelectJoins.Jets.InnerJoin.Pilots(ctx)
  ```

- Changed the `Count()` function on `Views` to clone the query instead of changing the existing one. This makes queries reusable and the `Count()` function to behave as one would expect.

  ```go
  // This now works as expected
  query := models.Jets.Query(ctx, db, /** list of various mods **/)
  count, err := query.Count()
  items, err := query.All()
  ```

- Changed how functions are modified. Instead of chained methods, the `F()` starter now returns a function which can be called with mods:

  ```go
  // Before
  psql.F( "count", "*",).FilterWhere(psql.Quote("status").EQ(psql.S("done"))),
  // After
  // import "github.com/stephenafamo/bob/dialect/psql/fm"
  psql.F( "count", "*",)(fm.Filter(psql.Quote("status").EQ(psql.S("done")))),
  ```

  This makes it possible to support more queries.

- Use `netip.Addr` instead of `netip.Prefix` for Postgres `cidr` type.
- Use `decimal.Decimal` instead of `string` for Postgres `money` type.
- Use `net.HardwareAddr` for Postgres `macaddr8` type, in addition to the `macaddr` type.
- Code generation now generates struct tags for the generated model Setters as well, if configured through the `Tags` configuration option. Previoulsy, only the model struct fields were tagged. (thanks @singhsays)

### Removed

- Remove `TableWhere` function from the generated code. It was not used by the rest of the generated code and offered no clear benefit.
- Removed `As` starter. It takes an `Expression` and is not needed since the `Expression` has an `As` method which can be used directly.

### Fixed

- Fix a bug with `types.Stringer[T]` where the wrong value was returned in the `Value()` method.

## [v0.26.1] - 2024-05-26

### Fixed

- Use `netip.Prefix` instead of `netip.Addr` for postgres inet column type. This makes it possible to contain a subnet.

- Fix an issue with title casing enum values

## [v0.26.0] - 2024-05-21

### Added

- Add `bobgen-sql` a code generation driver for SQL schema files. Supports PostgreSQL and SQLite.
- Add new properties `compare_expr` and `compare_expr_imports` to the `types` configuration. This is used when comparing primary keys and in testing.
- Add `never_required` to relationships configuration. This makes sure the factories does not require the relationship to be set. Useful if you're not using foreign keys. (thanks @jacobmolby)
- Add wrapper types for Stringer, TextMarshaler/Unmarshaler, and BinaryMarshaler/Unmarshaler to the `types` configuration.
- Make generated enum types implement the `fmt.Stringer`, `encoding.TextMarshaler`, `encoding.TextUnmarshaler`, `encoding.BinaryMarshaler` and `encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler` interfaces.

### Fixed

- It is now possible to configure additional constraints for code generation.
- Add `um.SetCol()` which maintains the old behavior of `um.Set()`.
- Generate additional `Expressions()` method for Setters to make it easier to use them in `um.Set()` or `im.Set()`.

### Changed

- Aliases configuration for code generation no longer has a top level `table` key
- When configuring relationships, `from_unique`, `to_unique`, `key_nullable` can no longer be configured. They are now inferred from the database.
- When configuring relationships, `to_key` has been changed to `modify` and should be set to `from`, `to` or `""` to indicate which side of the relationship to modify.
  If left empty, Bob will try to guess which side to modify based on the presence of primary keys and unique columns.
- `RelWhere.Value` is now `RelWhere.SQLValue`
- Change CONFLICT/DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE to use mods instead of a chainable methods.
- Change `um.Set()` to take a list of expressions.
- Rename Setter method from `Insert()` to `InsertMod()` to avoid confusion.

### Fixed

- Fix an issue where CTEs were encased in double parenthesis
- Fix invalid SQL generated when doing `JOIN USING`
- Correctly include "AS" in function query if alias is set

- Fix several issues with generating code for multi-sided relationships
- Fix an issue where loading many-to-many relationships cause no columns to be selected unless specified
- Fix an issue where many-to-many relationships would not be able to use nested loaders
